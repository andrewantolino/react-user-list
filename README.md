# React Fundamentals Practice Project

## Project Overview

This is a simple project intended to demonstrate usage of fundamental React concepts (outlined below)
in the context of a simple UI application that accepts and rendering user input. The user can input
their name and age and - provided their input passes simple validation checks - have their input rendered
to the UI in a `<UserList>` component. If the input is deemed invalid, a modal will pop up with a brief
error message.

## Concepts demonstrated

- Build app using `create-react-app`
- Render `React` components
- Pass data via `props`
- Set state data via `useState` hook
- Event handling
- Two-way binding
- Conditional rendering
- Styled components using `styled-components` package
- Re-usable components via `props.children`
- Lifting state up
